# Description

This directory contains scripts that will be evaluated when using some
particular _cluster provider_. They are intended to override some values
when running the performance tests, like the number of machines, the 
machines sizes, etc...

You can add your own `.local` files (that will not be included in Git)
for overriding things like the cluster region.
